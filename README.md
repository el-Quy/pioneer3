## 🤖 Quyzone – Phase 1 Web Development: Putting out my MVP (Minimal Viable Product) to the world


tentative launch: end of February
model kits of mechs but only the busts.  Gundam similar style design but original IP
USP: models are printable, posable, perfectible(customizable)

for users:
granular division of parts for easy painting.
animated building manual online + hierarchical building logic of subassemblies
friction based tension joints by using mini rubber bands.
pieces are made to all be printed on elegoo mars foot print size
cheaper dollar wise than buying same size gunplay
hitting the tranche of market of 3d resin printer owners who also like to make mecha model kits

for me:
animated manual for gaining/retaining traffic, great SEO, moat against piracy.
off-loading risk of shipping&handling, inventory, printing.
Extreme lean business, manageable with team of 1-3.

product:
3d files. STLS.  to be resin printed.  user pays for the files and prints it him/herself. Base model (skeleton) is as PayWahtYouWant.  Addons are behind paywall
articulations for the spine of the bust enhanced with cushioned parts casted (high friction rubber)are also orderable.
decals behind paywall

MVP(Pioneer3) is the skull PWYW

soon to come:
-addon as 3d printable skins 
-basic spine PWYW
-basic decals 

Medium term plans:
upgrade for the skull for:
-samurai-style
-medieval knight-style
-animalistic-style

future plans:
facilitate open source design for the mech
online marketplace to allow community to sells their own design.  I skim
online marketplace for artist to sell curated pieces to collectors.  I skim

phase N: 
vertical control of business selling modular 3dprinters made specifically to print parts for mech, intergrated with API for printing parts from my marketplace 
Sell equipement for weathering and painting
